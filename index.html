    <h1>About Mahir Shahriar</h1>
    <p>hi. I am Mahir, the person this website is about. i think its pretty narrcissistic of me to make a website about myself. As you can see, I am bad at spelling.
        I am currently a tutor at a local tutoring center in my area where I teach middle schoolers and people in 9th grade. I specialize in Math as thats what I was always good at and thank god we have a different tutor to teach these kids ELA. 
        I play a lot of games, too many actually. The games I do play are Valorant, Minecraft, Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail, Bloons Tower Defense 6 and recently F124. 
        I was once a top Minecraft PVP player, peaking at rank #11 globally on the ranked skywars leaderboards before the incident (iykyk). 
        I actually am a Forumula 1 fan, with my favorite drivers being Kimi Raikkonen, Fernando Alonso, Daniel Ricciardo and Yuki Tsunoda. Friendship ended with Scuderia Ferrai (forza ferrari) 
        and now I am a Mclaren fan for now.
